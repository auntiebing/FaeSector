It's time for a boy from the bottom of Chicomoztoc to show these shiny corporate princelings how to fight.

Disturbing reports of an Anamalous "Indigo Supergiant" have led some more superstisious Hegemony Officials to organize an offical expedition into the system. A small vanguard was sent ahead of the main Expedition fleet in order to scout the system.

Upon their arrival in the system, they find themselves face-to-face with the XRS Lupine piloted by "Pixie" a notorious Inran Officer and daughter of the Queen.

An experimental vessel, and the first of her class, the XRS Lupine is what some might call a "Strike Cruiser" and is more than capable of handling these threats herself.

The Lupine powers up weapons and moves to intercept. She will leave none standing.
