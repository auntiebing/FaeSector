lirim,WEAPON,"Launches electrically-charged plasma bolts at incredible speed. Devastating when fired in groups.

The bolts are fired in salvos of 6 and carry an EMP payload strong enough to punch through shields. Internal autoforges and generous capaciter allowance provide a steady supply of plasma, even during intense combat.
",,,,,,,
lupe,WEAPON,"A rapid-firing array of plasma blasters that, when fired in unison, can quickly overwhelm shields.

The Lupe is a scaled-down version of the ubiquitous Ulupe Assault Blaster that is more accurate, can fire faster, and disrupts shields. When paired together, they make a devastating combination.",,,,,,,
ulupe,WEAPON,"A long-ranged assault cannon that uses a miniaturized nuclear reactor to superheat gas into plasma.

The Ulupe becomes innacure very quickly under continued fire, due to strain on the single barrel. The reactors also require a rather large amount of flux to complete their firing cycle, putting a strain on even the most powerful of flux grids.",,,,,,,
tasuan,WEAPON,"A dual-barreled heavy assault cannon capable of tearing through any target it is pointed at.

A modified and upscaled Ulupe Assault Blaster using experimental Inran technology to modify the properties of the plasma after it has been heated. This results in an unstable, fast and incredibly explosive plasma bolt capable of dealing heavy damage to both armor and shields.",,,,,,,
